Description: ETMr runs the "embedded topic model" (ETM), which places words and topics in the same embedding
   space.  The embedded topic model produces interpretable topics and word embeddings that are robust to large
   vocabularies that include rare words and stop words. As the original algorithm is written in
   Python, ETMr provides R users with an interface to conveniently install and load Python,
   and then execute the embedded topic model, all without needing any prior knowledge of Python.
