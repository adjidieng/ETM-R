# ETM-R
R Package for ETM

(This R package is still under development.  The package may or may not be usable in its current state.  The package is expected to be usable by May 2021).

To do:
1. update authors page of DESCRIPTION file with up-to-date contact information.
2. convert data_nyt.py into a bash-able script (i.e. with arguments via argparser).  Specifically, need parameters in the form of minimum document frequency, maximum document frequency, the name of the stopwords text file, and the dataset file name/path.
3. Add scikit-learn as necessary Python package in the DESCRIPTION file.
4. Consider adding another use-case example (e.g. social media data)
