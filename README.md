# ETM-R
R Package for ETM

(This R package is still under development.  The package may or may not be usable in its current state.  The package is expected to be usable by July 2021).

To do:
1. add website using pkgdown
2. add raw text corpus or a script to directly download text corpus (e.g. 20ng)
3. add vignettes
4. rename the github repository as ETMr, rather than as ETM-R
